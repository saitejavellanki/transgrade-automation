You are given two JSON files:

1. `key.json`: This contains the official question structure. It defines the **correct number and order** of questions.
2. `student_answer.json`: This contains student answers. These may have:
   - Missing or incorrect question numbers.
   - Extra entries caused by **unintended splits** in a single answer (e.g., bullet points or continuation of an answer detected as a separate one).

Your task is to:
- Match each student answer to the correct question **by order**, using the order in the key as reference.
- If the student answer is **split across multiple entries** (e.g., a multi-line or multi-point answer mistakenly treated as separate answers), **merge them into one**.
- Do **not** invent or modify any content.
- Do **not** assign more student answers than actually exist.
- If the student answered fewer questions than expected, **leave out the unmatched questions**.
- The number of student answers in the final output should be equal to the number of **complete, merged answers** the student actually wrote (not the number of questions in the key).
- If there are extra answers due to split points, they must be **combined with their correct earlier parts**.

Your goal is to output a corrected `student_answer.json` where:
- Question numbers are inferred from the key order.
- The content is kept unchanged.
- Only the correct number of student answers is present, aligned properly by question.
- no markdown formatting

### Key JSON:
{json.dumps(key_data, indent=2)}

### Student Answer JSON:
{json.dumps(student_data, indent=2)}

Return ONLY the corrected with aligned and merged answers.
